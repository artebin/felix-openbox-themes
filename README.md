# felix-openbox-themes

Openbox themes that I use in my Linux setup.

  - felix-erthe: modified version of Erthe by Urukrama <https://github.com/urukrama/Themes>.
  - felix-nord: still based on Erthe but modified with a bash script handling a color palette, here it is Nord Polar Night <https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes>.
