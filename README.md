# felix-themes

## Openbox
  - felix-erthe: based on Erthe by Urukrama <https://github.com/urukrama/Themes>.
  - felix-nord: based on Erthe and modified with a bash script and a color palette.  
    The bash script factorizes Openbox theme parameters: for example the color for actived menu item will be the same as OSD actived button.  
    The palette is defined with bash and consists in a set of variables and an array.  
    This theme uses the Nord palettes <https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes>.
